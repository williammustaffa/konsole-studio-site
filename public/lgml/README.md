# Introduction

LGML is a framework that creates a similar syntax to the  GML *(Game Maker Language)* syntax. It also provides a lot of tools, such as **create**, **step** and **draw** lifecycles, **alarm** events, instance **depth** handling, pre-build collision, pre-build animation *(sprite_index)*, **rooms** and **viewport** support.

LGML is a free and open-source project made with LÃ¶ve2d.
