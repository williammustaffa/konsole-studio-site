# Quick Start

This is basically a love2d abstraction based on the game maker architecture and definitions.

## Instalation

This project requires only LÃ¶ve2d to run locally:

**LÃ¶ve2D:** Go to [LÃ¶ve2d website](https://love2d.org) and follow the instructions for your OS

## Usage

The project setup is really simple. First of all add `core` folder into your project, and in your `main.lua` file import it:
```
-- main.lua
require('core.LGML')({
  entry = 'path.to.game.entity',
  debug = true
})
``` 
In the example above we are passing the option `entry`. `entry` is the path to your `LGML.Game` entity that will contain all you game definition.

## Creating a game
The following structure is recommended for the use of this framework:

ðŸ“¦your-game folder
 â”£ ðŸ“‚core
 â”£ ðŸ“‚src
 â”ƒ â”£ ðŸ“‚assets
 â”ƒ â”£ ðŸ“‚objects
 â”ƒ â”£ ðŸ“‚rooms
 â”ƒ â”£ ðŸ“‚sprites
 â”ƒ â”— ðŸ“œGame.lua
 â”£ ðŸ“œconf.lua
 â”— ðŸ“œmain.lua
